# InMemoryDB Assignment

## Running the InMemoryDB Code

To run the InMemoryDB code, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
2. Download or clone the repository containing the InMemoryDB.java file.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing InMemoryDB.java.
4. Compile the code using the following command:

```
javac InMemoryDB.java
```

5. Once the compilation is successful, run the program with the following command:

```
java InMemoryDB
```

## Assignment Modification for Official Release

Recommended modifications:

1. **Additional Method Implementations**: Introduce additional methods to enhance functionality, such as a method to retrieve all keys, a method to check if a key exists, or a method to delete a key-value pair.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Provide more detailed error messages and handle edge cases more effectively, ensuring robustness and clarity in handling unexpected scenarios.

3. **Documentation and Comments**: Encourage students to provide comprehensive documentation and comments in their code to explain their implementation choices, making it easier for graders to understand their solutions.

4. **Unit Tests**: Include a set of predefined unit tests to evaluate the correctness of the implementation. This helps ensure that students' solutions meet the expected behavior and functionality requirements.

5. **Scalability Considerations**: Prompt students to consider how their implementation would scale to larger datasets or concurrent transactions, and provide guidance on optimizations or design choices to improve scalability.
